### Why MVVM?
We chose **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** because:

- üöÄ **Fast development**: Simple and lightweight, allowing us to implement features quickly.  
- üåç **Popular**: Widely adopted in the iOS community, with strong support and resources available.  
- üß™ **Easy unit testing**: Business logic is separated into the ViewModel, making testing straightforward without relying on UI components.  

This makes MVVM a practical choice where both **development speed** and **code quality** are priorities.
